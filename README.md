# sales-predictions
This project aimed to understand the influence of the type of products and outlets' location, size, and type on the outlet sales. It was applied a methodology focused on two critical aspects:
a. Describing the influence of different variables on the outlet sales graphically.
b. Applying machine learning algorithms to identify the most important variables affecting the outlet sales. 
# Summary of important results
A. Graphical description of the influence of important variables on outlet sales

## Figure 2: Item outlet sales by item type and fat content
Households, snacks, and fruits & vegetables are the more sold items. It is important to note that low fat content products are preferred by customers.

## Figure 3: Item outlet sales by outlet size and location
Medium size and tier 3 outlets gather the most of the outlet sales.

## Figure 4: Item outlet sales by outlet size and type
Medium size and supermarket type 1 outlets gather the most of the outlet sales.

## Figure 5: Correlation matrix
The correlation matrix reveals that there are no correlation among variables, with the exception of Item MRP on item outlet sales.
